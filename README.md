# TS Contributors React App
## Overview
Super basic app, it accesses the Github API, it then fetches users and populates the app with it. You can search for people and some other features will be added, but it's going to be a quick, simple, React app.

There will not be tests, and this app will be made with plain JavaScript, so no TypeScript.
